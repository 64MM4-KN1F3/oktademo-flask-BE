# oktademo-awfl
AWS Flask App for okta demo

In particular, this will be the API backend which will be acccessed by the front end app: oktademo_HowRU.

oktademo-awfl will allow for GET, POST methods and be connected to by the front end by OAuth shared secret.

oktademo-awfl will also allow user/password Oauth authentication for native app access. this will only return data limited to the account authenticated.

oktademo_HowRU will allow for standard user access and admin access. Admin can add, remove and view all account data. If I have time the admin will be able to see visual charts of backend data.
